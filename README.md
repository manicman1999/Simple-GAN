# Simple-GAN

This is an implementation of DCGAN for 32x32 images of swords. It is very simple, and is meant for those just getting into GANs. The GAN trains (relatively) quickly and works (relatively) consistently.

In order to use, simply download or clone the repository and run gan.py. All data used is included in the /data/ folder!

Enjoy!
